# Geolocation should be off by default during a kickstart installation.
# This can be tested by checking if the sensitive-info log contains
# any results from a geolocation lookup - there should not be any
# during a default kickstart installation.

# first check the anaconda log

# then the sensitive-info log where geolocation record lookup results
