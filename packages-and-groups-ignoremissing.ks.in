#test name: packages-and-groups-ignoremissing
#
# what we are testing there:
# - that multiple missing packages & groups (at the same time) are ignored
#   if --ignoremissing is used
# - that regular packages and groups requested at the same time
#   are installed correctly
# - that such an installation finishes successfully
