Provisioning hosts for remote tests in a cloud
==============================================

Using `linchpin` the hosts can be provisioned and respective inventory created for deployment of the hosts for remote tests using [ansible playbooks](../ansible).

Linchpin installation
---------------------

Linchpin `pip` installation in `virtualenv` is desribed in [documentation](https://linchpin.readthedocs.io)

Credentials
-----------

* The cloud credentials need to be configured in the file and profile reffered by `credentials` variable of [topologies/kstests.yml](topologies/kstests.yml). So the credentials file `clouds.yml` should contain profile `ci-rhos`. The path to the directory containing the file is provided by `linchpin` `--creds-path` option.

```
clouds:
  ci-rhos:
    auth:
      auth_url:
      project_name:
      username:
      password:
```

* Ssh keys for provisioned hosts are defined in [topologies/kstests.yml](topologies/kstests.yml), for example by `keypair` value for openstack. The key will be later needed to [configure](../ansible/ansible.cfg) ansible for running the [deployment playbooks](../ansible) on the provisioned hosts.


Configuration
-------------

* Number of hosts to be provisioned can be configured by `count` variable in [topologies/kstests.yml](topologies/kstests.yml) and [layouts/kstests.yml](layouts/kstests.yml).

  * `kstest` are hosts on which remote tests are to be run (deployed by [kstest](../ansible/roles/kstest) role)
  * `kstest-master` is a host from which remote tests can be run (deployed by [kstest-master](../ansible/roles/kstest-master))

* The provisioning parameters (image, host flavor, etc...) are configured in [topologies/kstests.yml](topologies/kstests.yml).

Example 1: a test run from a local host on remote hosts in a cloud
------------------------------------------------------------------

The test will be run from local host on `kstest` hosts provisioned with `linchpin` and deployed with `kstest` ansible playbook.

* The cloud credentials and number of `kstest` instances should be configured as described above in [Credentials](#credentials) and [Configuration](#configuration). There is no need for `kstest-master` instance.
* Ansible and the deployment playbook should be configured as described in [kstest](../ansible/roles/kstest#remote-hosts-deployment) role

From the `kickstart-tests` directory provision and deploy remote hosts (`kstest` instances):

```
rm linchpin/inventories/kstests-*.inventory
linchpin -v --creds-path <PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS> --workspace linchpin -c linchpin/linchpin.conf up
cp linchpin/inventories/kstests-*.inventory ansible/inventory/linchpin.kstests
cd ansible
ansible-playbook kstest.yml
cd -
```

IP addresses of provisioned hosts can be found in the inventory generated by `linchpin`:
```
cat ansible/inventory/linchpin.kstests
```

Run the test providing the IP addresses from the inventory:
```
$ TEST_REMOTES=<IP1 IP2 ...> TEST_REMOTES_ONLY=yes scripts/run_kickstart_tests.sh -i ../boot.iso -k 1 hostname.sh user.sh
```
(see [kstest](../ansible/roles/kstest#running-the-test) role documentation for details)

To remove the hosts from the cloud:
```
$ linchpin -v --creds-path <PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS> --workspace linchpin -c linchpin/linchpin.conf destroy
```
Example 2: a test run completely in a cloud
-------------------------------------------

The test will be run from `kstest-master` on the master and additional `kstest` hosts.

* The cloud credentials and number of `kstest` instances should be configured as described above in [Credentials](#credentials) and [Configuration](#configuration).
* Ansible and the deployment playbooks should be configured as described in [../ansible/README.md](../ansible/README.md)
* The test parameters can be configured as described in [kstest-master](../ansible/roles/kstest-master) role.
  * either by modifying the [ansible variables file](../ansible/roles/kstest-master/defaults/main.yml) before running the `kstest-master.yml` playbook in the script
  * or by supplying the values via `--extra-vars` option to the `kstest-master.yml` playbook in the script

Example of a script that would be run from kickstart-tests repository directory.

```
#!/bin/bash

set -ex

# Clean up linchpin inventory dir
rm linchpin/inventories/kstests-*.inventory

# Provision the hosts
linchpin -v --creds-path <PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS> --workspace linchpin -c linchpin/linchpin.conf up

# Pass resulting inventory to ansible
cp linchpin/inventories/kstests-*.inventory ansible/inventory/linchpin.kstests

cd ansible

# Deploy the hosts
ansible-playbook kstest.yml

# Deploy the master and configure the test
ansible-playbook kstest-master.yml

# Run the test
ansible kstest-master -m shell -a "PATH=$PATH:/usr/sbin ~/run_tests.sh" -u kstest

cd -

# Destroy the provisioned hosts
linchpin -v --creds-path <PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS> --workspace linchpin -c linchpin/linchpin.conf destroy
```

The script updated with configuration checks and hints: [../run_tests_in_cloud.sh](../run_tests_in_cloud.sh)

Example 3: scheduling tests run completely in cloud
---------------------------------------------------

To schedule tests in cloud, two approaches can be used.

### 3A: One-shot test runners provisioned for test scheduled from local host

The runners are provisioned when the test scheduled (using user systemd timer) from local host is run and are destroyed after the test finishes.

* Configure runners provisioning with linchpin as described above in [Credentials](#credentials) and [Configuration](#configuration).
* Configure the test and syncing to remote host (`kstest_remote_results_path` variable) with kstest-master role [test config](../ansible/roles/kstest-master/defaults/main.yml).
```
vim ansible/roles/kstest-master/defaults/main.yml
```
* Schedule the test from local host using [`schedule_tests.yml`](schedule_tests.yml) playbook and its [configuration file](roles/schedule/defaults/main.yml):
```
vim linchpin/roles/schedule/defaults/main.yml
ansible-playbook linchpin/schedule_tests.yml
```

* To disable the scheduled test and clean up created files run
```
ansible-playbook linchpin/remove_scheduled_tests.yml
```

### 3B: Persistent test runners in cloud

All runners are persistent, the tests are scheduled (using `cron`) from the master runner.

* Provision test runners, eg using linchpin as described in the previous [example](#example-2-a-test-run-completely-in-a-cloud).
* Deploy the runners with ansible playbooks eg as described in the previous [example](#example-2-a-test-run-completely-in-a-cloud).

* Configure the test with kstest-master role [test config](../ansible/roles/kstest-master/defaults/main.yml) and apply the configuration to the `kstest-master`. Optionally configure syncing from master runner with `remote_results_path`.
```
cd ansible
vim roles/kstest-master/defaults/main.yml
ansible-palybook --tags=configure-test kstest-master.yml
```
* Schedule test from master in kstest-master role [master config](../ansible/roles/kstest-master/vars/main.yml) (`kstest.master.cron`) and apply the configuration to the `kstest-master`.
```
cd ansible
vim roles/kstest-master/vars/main.yml
ansible-playbook --tags=schedule-test kstest-master.yml
```
